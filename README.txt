My passion project game about flinging yourself around in a star system in the fastest way, heavily inspired by The Expanse S3E07, I recommend:
"Highway Star (Belter Version)" by Cory Todd
as background music, it's at least on Youtube and Spotify.

This is the public repo where you can get the game files, but not the source code (got a private repo for that).
The release tab always has a SSR.zip and autogenerated source code zips, they are literally the same thing, but source code doesn't imply that you actually get an exe, so I double add the zip to make it obvious.

When opening a bug-issue, add version in title, since apparently the release tags are separate from the issue labels and you cant use them there????
