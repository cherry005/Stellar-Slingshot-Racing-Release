Beta-2.1.1

Features:
- added decorative asteroid belt, I made the sprites at the beginning and finally got to use them, this can take a few seconds to generate
- pause menu now shows seed
- added hint to planet/moon range setting for min/max values and set proper default values

Fixes:
- fixed preview, now dynamically adjusts to number of planets
- min and max values can now be set to same value to choose exact number of generated planets/moons
- pause menu correctly drawn over hud (its supposed to be darker, it wasnt, now it is again)
- camera no longer movable while in pause menu
- increased default starting speed to 2500, to start in a relatively stable orbit (depending on planets)
