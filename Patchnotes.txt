Beta-1.1.0

Features:
- added main menu when starting
- added settings menu, with graphics option (just one), placeholder audio options and control rebinds
note: currently no way to exit game once you start from main menu, you will have to close and relaunch whole thing, also the controls dont get 
saved for next time, kinda forgot about that, will be done
- added proper icon for exe instead of default Godot icon

Fixes:
- none! everything works perfectly, trust

Other:
- found out i can just embed the .pck file in the exe, idk why it's not default, but i've done that now, so no more .pck which
- there's probably no way past the windows defender warning, since a certificate costs a shit ton of money
