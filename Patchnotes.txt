Beta-2.0.0

Holy shit it's finally done, I hope it'll be worth it frfr

Features:
- upgraded to Godot 4.4.1, including rebuilding and fixing a lot of stuff
- made custom gravity since the new built-in system didnt work for this game, gravity now stronger in general and especially near celestial bodies
- optimized path drawing (aka dont draw things that arent visible)

Also be aware that the settings file is reset to default values, because the way Godot 4 saves keybinds is different from Godot 3 and it's easiest to just regenerate
the file. The old one is still in "$appdata$\Godot\app_userdata\Stellar Slingshot Racing", just renamed to "settings_prevVersion.cfg", not that it's any helpful since
it's not really readable.
