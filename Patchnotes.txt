vAlpha-1.3.0

Features:
- added first gameplay bit, now generates race gates which you have to fly through to "win"
  more gameplay things are planned, mostly fuel constraint and a timer, to a) make slingshots more important and b) actually have some sort of racing aspect
  when these are done, the game is going to enter beta, i guess
- put in some information in the godot export template, internet people say it might help with windows defender warning, idk if true tho (i dont get the warning)

Fixes:
- none! everything works perfectly, trust
