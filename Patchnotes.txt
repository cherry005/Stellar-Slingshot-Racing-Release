WAHOO! YIPPEE! It's Beta time (because it has a core gameplay loop now and because I say so). It'll probably stay like this for a while, there's still tons of things to add and polish up for full release, but as an appetizer I have a...

Roadmap:
- add a start and pause menu
- start menu should give option to use a preset seed to compare to friends
- some kind of difficulty options, either preset or free to choose (example: fuel amount)
- second game mode?!? o.o
- general polish
- find and fix bugs
- make keybinds changeable

Beta-1.0.0
Features:
- added stopwatch at top
- added fuel bar for main engine, currently set to 300 seconds of thrust, subject to change
- added more/alternative keyboard controls for camera, plus/minus to zoom, backspace to refocus on ship (in addition to home-key)

Fixes:
- none! everything works perfectly, trust

Other:
- dropped the v from the version number, ruins flow and pretty much unnecessary, I think this still doesn't quite fit the usual versioning conventions, but my game my rules
- made a readme for the git, contains default controls instead of a screenshot
